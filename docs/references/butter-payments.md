About Butter Payments:
At Butter Payments, we’re on a mission to eliminate involuntary churn and make recurring payments seamless. Every year, billions of dollars are lost due to failed payments. Butter leverages machine learning, deep financial data partnerships, and behavioral insights to ensure the right payments go through at the right time—without friction. We're backed by world-class investors like Atomic, Norwest Venture Partners, SpringTride, Transpose Platform, and we're growing fast.

The Problem Statement:
You will work closely with Software Engineering, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Analysts. You help ingest, organize and enable Butter to continue to deliver value on the data we collect. We make sure it arrives in a timely manner, is organized and usable, and is of a high quality. Key to all the work Butter does.

Problem Expanded:
We ingest 3rd-party data from multiple payment providers, such as Stripe, clean it and normalize it for our schema and machine learning pipelines.

We're seeking to build transformation and validation layers as far upstream as possible to ensure a smooth flow of data through our system. The transformation layer will make the data easier to work with for our reporting products and ML models, while the validation layer will ensure the data conforms to our expectations. For example: Is it null, NULL, or 'null'? Is 342 a valid country abbreviation code?

As we expand our product offering and ingest data from additional companies and 3rd-party providers the complexity of the challenge will evolve over time, keeping the problem fresh.

Scope:
You'll get to architect our system and lay the foundation for the future from both a technology and a system design perspective.

No longer will data show up without being tested and structured, as you'll create a system that checks its worst tendencies. You'll work closely with our ML and Eng team to ensure the design meets their requirements and that data properly flows through the system.
